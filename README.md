# Steam Collection Download Size Calculator

Several months ago, I was looking for a viable way to calculate the total size of a Workshop collection for my Garry's Mod server, so I created a Lua script using the internal [Facepunch Steamworks library](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/steamworks) but I also wanted to have this way without necessarily going through the server console or turning on my game.

So I thought that using the shell (without going into a GUI) and creating a small program to get this result would be a good way to train myself in C# since my knowledge is limited to the classes but also it allows me to have a quick way to calculate a Workshop collection.

There might be some problems/inconsistencies in the code but of course any report/pull request are welcome!
